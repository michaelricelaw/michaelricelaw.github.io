Have you tried out the new desktop version of Remix? Looking for a contributor code of conduct in Solidity? Need your latest fix on the Ripple ICO securities litigation? We've got you covered in today's daily update.

## Solidity Buidl Updates

Part 3 of a [fairly detailed Solidity tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-ethereum-dapps-whitelisting-testing-story-dao/) is out. I still haven't tried it myself, but it looks complete enough (including unit tests) that I thought I'd share it.

Just noticed that a few days ago someone dropped a [desktop version of Remix based on Electron](https://github.com/horizon-games/remix-app/releases/tag/0.2.0). Call me old school, but in my mind a development environment needs to run local. I know, I know -- the web-based ones are getting better and better and Electron isn't a whole lot more than the web version, but.... still.....

Maybe good news for the Solidity open source contributor community, they're working [on a code of conduct](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/4453) based on [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org).

## Legal Updates

Need to update [my Medium post on the Ripple ICO litigation](https://medium.com/@michaelricelaw/obscure-remand-motion-may-resolve-the-ico-securities-question-in-the-ripple-litigation-edc6359d5b78), but Ripple recently filed a paper in it's ICO litigation that I was hoping would reveal something about how it would argue that XRP is not a security. Unfortunately, it looks like they're largely sidestepping the issue. They made a passing reference to the point that XRP may be better classified as a commodity, but that's about it.

Who knows though -- the court may independently declare that it needs to resolve the securities question, so let's see what happens. Tempting to fly up from Los Angeles for the hearing (August 1).

Interesting article on [the rise of the Equity Token Offering](https://nulltx.com/what-is-an-equity-token-offering-eto/) ("ETO") in Germany and the new ICO, sliding-scale regulatory framework in Malta.

Securities law isn't all about the Securities and Exchange Commission. Most states have so-called "Blue Sky Laws" that also regulate securities in some instances. Texas recently invoked its Blue Sky regulatory authority to [issue cease and desist orders against seven ICOs](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2018/07/texas-securities-board-issues-cease-and-desist-to-five-crypto-companies/).

"[M]arket cap and investor returns alone may be poor indicators for whether a fledgling industry is growing" said a [recent Bitcoin Magazine post](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/beyond-classroom-rise-university-blockchain-labs/) describing the growth of university blockchain labs, labs that are "creating the infrastructure to push blockchain development through a new era of mainstream exposure to mainstream adoption."
