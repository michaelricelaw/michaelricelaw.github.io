excerpt: Been really bad about keeping this up to date; need to get back to the hustle. Got a basic ERC20 Solidity tutorial for you and a solicitor with an opinion on the blockchain and marmots.

Gotta get back to posting these daily! I've got some stuff going on tonight, so we'll just do two quick posts.

## Solidity community updates

[Solid ERC20 tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-ethereum-dapps-tns-tokens/) slow walking you through an ERC20 implementation with the addition of token locking. Pretty good. Give it a try and let me know what you think.

## Legal smart contract links

**Preston Byrne**, a British solicitor and advisor to law firms, says "code as law" is [rubbish](https://cryptoinsider.21mil.com/law-blockchains-marmots-interview-preston-byrne/). (Actually, he said "garbage" but I thought rubbish would have been more entertaining to my American ear.) Then he walks it back a bit with, "Code is law makes some sense. But ultimately, the legal system is backed by men with guns, who will tell us what we can and can’t do – if we don’t comply, we end up in jail, or worst case scenario, shot." And there's a section on marmots too.
